# Mapping_Earthquakes
### FYI: All of my module work and Challenge work is on the Earthquake_Challenge branch.

### This module was a fun one. Utilizing geoJSON to create intricate maps to see where earthquakes are happening every hour and mapping out the tectonic plates all over the world was very informative and interesting. I first had to call the URL's using d3.json and assigning the URL to the d3.json so it knew where to pull the information from. Next, I created the data point where the earthquakes are currently happening and assigned a color and circleMarker to the specific magnitudes I detailed in my if statements. After that, I created a tectonic plates outlay where I mapped out the tectonic plates around the world using a json file found on github. Then, I added in a light tile layer so the map had three different tile layers to toggle from. Finally, I made the streets tile layer the default so whenever someone load my code it starts out in the streets version. THis challenge was fun and difficult, and learning the branches on github is very difficult as well!
